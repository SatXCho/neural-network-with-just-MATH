# neural-network-with-just-MATH
A neural network made using just python and numpy. No funny frameworks/tools.

I made this purely to smite [@gauthamk02](https://github.com/gauthamk02)

<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A character recognizer trained on EMNIST.</li>
  <li>Backward propagation GD Learning rate: 0.1</li>
  <li>May take a 1000 epochs to train to ~93% accuracy.</li>
  <li>You might want to use mini-batch GD if you want to use this.</li>
</ul>
